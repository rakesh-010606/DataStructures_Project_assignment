Interactive Quiz System using Queue, Stack, and Linked List
Overview

This project was developed for the CSLR31 – Data Structures Laboratory at NIT Trichy.
It demonstrates how fundamental data structures — Queue, Stack, and Linked List — can be integrated into a real-world educational product.

The system generates random math questions, manages them in a queue, tracks attempts using a stack, and stores scores dynamically using a linked list.
